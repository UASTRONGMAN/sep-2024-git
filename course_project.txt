The Simpsons Heroes

Homer Jay Simpson, temporarily known as Max Power, is the main protagonist of The Simpsons franchise.

He is the father of the Simpson family, being the husband of Marge, and the father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie.

He is an overweight, lazy, and ignorant man, but is strongly devoted to his wife and children. Despite his flaws and his below average intelligence he has shown moments of great high intelligence as well as being a loving and caring father and husband at times. Homer works as a safety inspector low level in Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, in Sector 7-G, although he is often incompetent and mostly sleeps in the service and eats donuts. He spends much of his time at Moe's Tavern with his lifelong friends Barney, Carl, Lenny, and bartender Moe to drink beers. He also went Krusty Burger to eat burgers and fries. At home, he is often sitting on the couch, watching TV while mindlessly eating food and drinking Duff. Homer is the only son of Abe and Mona and he has long-lost half-brother, Herbert Powell which he calls him Herb who is Bart, Lisa and Maggie's paternal uncle.
Homer always strangles his own son, Bart, for his actions and disrespecting him on purpose.
